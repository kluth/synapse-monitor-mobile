# Synapse Monitor (Flutter App)

[](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[](https://flutter.dev)
[](https://dart.dev)

A mobile dashboard built with Flutter for monitoring and visualizing the health and functionalities of [Synapse-Framework](https://github.com/kluth/synapse)-based distributed systems.

## 📝 Overview

The [Synapse Framework](https://github.com/kluth/synapse) by kluth models distributed systems as biologically-inspired neural networks, where microservices act as "neurons" and connections as "synapses."

This **Synapse Monitor App** serves as a mobile command center, connecting to an existing Synapse backend to visualize its state, performance, and topology in real-time. It provides administrators and developers with a mission-critical overview of system health directly from their mobile devices.

## ✨ Features

  * **Real-time Dashboard:** A global overview of the entire neural network's health status.
  * **Neuron Visualization:** A detailed list and inspection view for all `NeuralNode`, `CorticalNeuron`, and `ReflexNeuron` instances.
      * Status (active, inactive)
      * Activation thresholds
      * Processed signal counts
  * **Synapse Inspection:** Graphical representation of the `Synaptic Connections` between neurons.
      * Connection Weight
      * Signal Type (Excitatory/Inhibitory)
      * Transmission Speed
  * **Glial Cell Metrics:** Monitoring of the core support infrastructure.
      * **Astrocyte (Cache):** Displays cache size, hit rate, and TTL statistics.
  * **System Health:** Visualizes error rates and neuroplasticity metrics (e.g., self-healing events).
  * **Push Notifications:** Configurable alerts for critical system events (e.g., neuron failure, high error rates).
